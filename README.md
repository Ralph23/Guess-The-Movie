# Guess-The-Movie
First project in [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud283) in Udacity

The computer randomly picks a movie title from a list of movies, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. The goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.

If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, you lose a point. If you lose 10 points, game over.
